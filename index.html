								By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop, the Customer
								agrees that it is bound by these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders
								placed via the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's
								order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and
								Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the
								Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any
								subsequent orders placed by the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied.
								Once a Customer order has been placed and accepted by Shop, the Customer agrees that the
								Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by
								both parties.
							</p>

								notice to the Customer.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="list__section">
							<h3 class="section__title">Prices / Taxes</h3>
							<p class="section__text">
								The prices charged by and payable to Shop will be the ruling prices applicable at the time of
								order placement, provided that the Products are accepted for delivery within a reasonable time.
								Prices are subject to change without notice. Recommended retail prices are provided for
								indicative purposes only and there is no obligation for Shop to comply with that recommendation.
								It as agreed that should the Customer fail for any reason to acquire the quantity of Products
								sold then without limiting Shop' other rights and remedies the unit price charged for the goods
								sold may be amended to take into account any variation in the total quantity purchased by the
								Customer. Prices include GST, but do not include any other tax or duty, which is in addition to
								the price and is to be paid by the Customer at the time of payment for the Products.

							<p class="section__text margin">
								Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Shop, where Shop has not agreed in writing to provide
								commercial credit to the Customer, the total purchase price for Products supplied will be due
								for payment in cash prior to delivery.

							<h3 class="section__title">Credit Accounts</h3>
							<p class="section__text">

							<h3 class="section__title">Change of Ownership</h3>
							<p class="section__text margin">
								Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the representations
								made by the Customer. In the event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether
								total or partial, the Customer must immediately provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of
								these changes. Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer of a change in ownership,
								the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds
								Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs, charges,
								fees and expenses incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company (including
								the same company but with a different shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a
								trust) which may have purchased the Customer's business or any interest in the Customer's
								business or any of the shares in the Customer and used the Customer's previously approved
								account for trading.
							</p>
							<p class="section__text">
								Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct Debit,
								the Customer must provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in
								ownership of the business to allow Shop sufficient time to contact the new owner to obtain and
								confirm new Credit Card information if applicable.

								for meeting special (i.e. Tasmania / Northern Territory Deliveries) or urgent delivery
								arrangements, these additional costs may be charged to the Customer and may include the cost of
								airfreight where it is not the normal method of delivery. The Customer agrees to accept delivery
								of the Products sold at any time during normal business hours.
							</p>
							<p class="section__text">

								and late delivery will not entitle the Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's order for
								the Products.
